DTSA 5798 Supervised Text Classification for Marketing Analytics Final Project

## Abstract

A report focused on modeling news article categorization for marketing analytics. This notebook focuses on the application of natural language processing, supervised learning with k-train (a wrapper for Tensorflow, Keras, and Huggingface Transformers), and a evaluation of performance. The project was initially worked on Google Colab but I run out of computation credit quickly so I decided to use Jupyter notebook instead.
